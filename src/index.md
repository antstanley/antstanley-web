I am a community focused technologist with a passion for enabling better outcomes for society through technology.  I run the [Serverless London User Group](https://www.meetup.com/Serverless-London/), co-run [ServerlessDays London](https://london.serverlessdays.io) and am part of the [ServerlessDays](https://serverlessdays.io) Global team.

Previously I [co-founded A Cloud Guru](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/cloud-skills-future-work-anthony-stanley/?articleId=6054611795497283584) along with Ryan and Sam Kroonenburg. Whilst at A Cloud Guru I [ran the first ServerlessConf](https://serverlesscode.com/post/serverless-conf-is-here/), the first Serverless conference in the world. I left A Cloud Guru after [a busy 14 months](https://precipitation.io/the-last-fourteen-months-a77769887f8b).

Before diving into startup world I worked at a number of service providers and telecommunications companies, primarily as a Solution Architect, such as Sungard Availability Services and Level 3 Communications. Working on a variety of projects, from infrastructure design for a PCI-DSS compliant ecommerce site with over $1 billion in annual revenue, to secure access gateways for a local UK government body built to IL3 standards.

My focus today is all things Serverless, Cloud, GraphQL and Node.js. My career has seen me do almost every role in tech, from my first job in tech doing Y2K upgrades of workstations running OS2/Warp in 1999, through to 5 years writing VB6 for a living, working as MS SQL DBA for a few years, many years as a Solution Architect in various roles, and even a stint as a Vendor Alliance Manager.

If you need help with Cloud Architecture, Serverless, or GraphQL feel free to contact me at [hello@antstanley.me](mailto:hello@antstanley.me) or [DM me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/iamstan)
